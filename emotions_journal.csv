2025-02-02,"Life feels like an endless loop of sadness, a hollow existence where every day blends into the next without meaning. I wake up tired, not from lack of sleep but from the weight of simply being. The world moves on around me, yet I remain stuck, drowning in thoughts I can’t escape. I try to smile, to pretend that everything is fine, but inside, I am breaking. The loneliness is unbearable, even in a room full of people. I scream silently, hoping someone will notice, but no one ever does. Dreams that once burned brightly have faded into shadows, and hope feels like a distant memory. I wonder if things will ever change or if this sadness is all that’s left for me. It hurts to breathe, to exist, to be. Maybe tomorrow will be different, but deep down, I fear that tomorrow will be just the same.",0.0057,0.0088,0.0526,0.0013,0.0232,0.9024,0.006,sadness
